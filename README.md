# A Comprehensive Review of Bosonic Quantum Error Correcting Codes


Quantum error correction is essential for reliable fault-tolerant quantum computing, necessitating the encoding of information redundantly into
physical degrees of freedom to safeguard it against noise. A prominent approach involves continuous variable quantum information processing using bosonic
modes. This technique 
encodes information within the harmonic oscillator's occupation number space, expressed through number states $\{\ket{n}\}^\infty_{n=0}$, 
position and momentum eigenstates ![lagrida_latex_editor (2)](https://github.com/Riddhiman2005/A-Comprehensive-Review-of-Bosonic-Quantum-Error-Correcting-Codes/assets/130882317/6e3da06d-52db-4b89-b6a8-7ecda620f414) and

The initial continuous variable scheme involving bosonic modes is the 
two-mode "dual-rail" encoding, introduced in 1995. Presently, numerous bosonic codes are under assessment for their 
potential in fault-tolerant quantum computation. This review will focus on key contenders: firstly, establishing a pragmatic bosonic error model; 
proceeding to explore three prominent single-mode codes renowned for their robust protection against this model; evaluating the performance of these codes, 
considering relevant theoretical aspects based on the work by Albert, Noh, Duivenvoorden, Young, Brierley, Reinhold; and finally, delving into 
hardware-efficient multi-mode extensions, 
notable for their strides towards feasible physical implementation. These extensions will be situated within the evolving realm of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes.
